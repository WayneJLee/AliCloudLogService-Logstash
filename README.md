# AliCloud Logstash Setup

This repository contains an updated AliCloud Log Service script that supports PKI authentication, on top of the built in TLS, via Logstash. This repository was made for a PoC and will not be maintained.

# Warning

Due to major inconsistencies in logging and the lack of documentation for Log Service, the Grok patterns were built based on what we were receiving from Log Service. This config is definitely not production-ready so use at your own risk.
